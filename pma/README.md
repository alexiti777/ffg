### Test the app with Expo Go

To test the app, scan the QR code below using the **Expo Go** app (Android) or using the **Camera** app (iPhone)

> **Note**: Some features, like automatic Wi-Fi connection after scanning a QR code, won't work in Expo Go because the app is running in **Expo's managed workflow**. This workflow has limitations on accessing certain native functionality. To use these advanced features, the app needs to be built as a standalone app.
